## Stripe Payment

The Stripe Payments plugin allows you to accept credit card payments via Stripe payment gateway on your Strapi site easily.

Your customers will be redirected to the ‚ÄúCheckout Result‚Äù page after the credit card payment. This page shows them the details of the transaction (the item that they just paid for).

The transaction info is also captured in the Report section of the plugin. You can view all the payments you received from your Strapi admin dashboard.

The setup is very easy. Once you have installed the plugin, all you need to do is enter your Stripe API credentials in the plugin settings and your website will be ready to accept credit card payments.

You can run it in test mode by specifying test API keys in the plugin settings.

It has a simple embed code that lets you put Stripe ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù buttons anywhere on your site for any products that you sell online.
